# Third-Party-Screening-and-Billing-Report-Analysis-with-Pivot-Table-and-VLOOKUP

For this project, I leveraged Excel functions such as VLOOKUP and Pivot Tables to streamline data analysis for third-party screening services and vendor billing. Using VLOOKUP, I merged datasets from the screening reports and vendor invoices, enabling the integration of relevant details such as sponsor divisions and report costs. The Pivot Table was then used to efficiently summarize and analyze key metrics, including the number of reports ordered by each country and the total expenditure per country. Additionally, it provided insights into report color distribution by division, supporting data-driven decisions for performance tracking and cost management across the organization.
